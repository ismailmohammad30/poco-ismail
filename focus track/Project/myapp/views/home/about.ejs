    <h1 class="size">WHAT THIS CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT</h1>
    <br>
    <h2 class="size" style="color:green;">This campaign has one main objective: to find sustainable and effective solutions to Britain’s epidemic of litter and fly-tipping.</h2>
    <br>
    <h3 class="size" style="color: red;">Of course, that’s easy to say, but very difficult to achieve.  In reality, changing the behaviour of the 20 million people in Britain who litter is the only answer.</h3>
    <br>
    <h5 class="size" >There are hundreds of thousands of community-spirited people who pick up litter.  In the short term, this is great, but it’s also a bit like mopping-up while the taps are still running…. the litter will just keep coming again and again, forever.  Our campaign is about turning the taps off.</h5>
    <br>
    <h3 class="size" style="color: green;">It’s also about trying to force the government to address the numerous and deep systemic failures in both central and local government.</h3>
    <br>
    <h4 class="size">Two examples of these failures are:</h4>
    <br>
    <h5 class="size">Highways England does an appalling job in cleaning up litter on the motorways.  Their bosses at the Department of Transport don’t set them a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) for cleaning up litter.  In other words, Highways England are not judged on whether they clean up litter or not.  Consequently, they do a terrible job, no one in government cares and our motorways continue to look like a dumping ground.</h5>
    <br>
    <h5 class="size">For some unknown and senseless reason, the responsibility of ‘looking after’ non-motorway roads is split between County Councils and local (usually District) Councils.  The former is responsible for cutting grass by the side of the road and the latter for litter-picking.  So two different organisations do two different jobs at two different times, the result being litter diced into tiny pieces as no-one has removed it before the verges are cut.  No-one takes responsibility.</h5>
